      Did you hear about the rose that grew<br>
      from a crack in the concrete? <br>
      Proving nature's law is wrong it <br>
      learned to walk with out having feet. <br>
      Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams, <br>
      it learned to breathe fresh air. <br>
      Long live the rose that grew from concrete <br>
      when no one else ever cared.

      She had blue skin,<br>
      And so did he.<br>
      He kept it hid<br>
      And so did she.<br>
      They searched for blue<br>
      their whole life through.<br>
      Then passed right byâ€“<br>
      And never knew.<br>

    <p>
      Time is too long for life;<br>
      For knowledge not enough.<br>
      What have we come for, night, heart of night?<br>
      Dream that we do not die<br>
      And, at times, for a moment, wake.
